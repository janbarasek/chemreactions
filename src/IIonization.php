	 Ionization of a Carbon - Leaving Group Bond. When a bond between a carbon atom and a leaving group ionizes, the leaving group accepts the pair of electrons that used to be shared in the covalent bond. This may leave the carbon atom with an open octet, resulting in a carbocation. The ionization is indicated with a curved arrow starting at the bond and pointing to the leaving group atom that accepts the electron pair. Better leaving groups or formation of a more stable carbocation result in lower activation energy and faster ionization. Carbon - leaving group bonding ionization is illustrated using an oxonium ion.
