	 B. Addition of Water: Acid-Catalyzed Hydration
	Hydration
	The addition of water.
	In the presence of an acid catalyst, most commonly concentrated sulfuric acid, water adds to an alkene to give an alcohol. The addition of water is called hydration.
	
	In the case of simple alkenes, H adds to the carbon of the double bond with the greater number of hydrogens and OH adds to the carbon with the fewer hydrogens. Thus, H!OH adds to alkenes in accordance with Markovnikov’s rule.
