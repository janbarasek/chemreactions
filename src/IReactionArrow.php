            First Rule: Arrows are used to indicate movement of electrons.
            Second Rule: Arrows are never used to indicate the movement of atoms directly. The arrows only show atom movement indirectly as a consequence of electron move- ment when covalent bonds are made and broken.
         Fourth Rule: Bond breaking will occur to avoid overfilling valence (hypervalence) on an atom serving as an electron sink.
    In these cases, the electron source for the arrow is the bond being broken and the sink is an atom able to accommodate the electrons as a lone pair, generally an elec- tronegative atom such as an O atom or a halogen. If an ion is created, that ion is often stabilized by resonance delocalization or other stabilizing interactions.

            Electron source
    A bond or lone pair of electrons, usually an area of relatively high electron density, that serves as
    the origin of a mechanism arrow. An electron source characteristically interacts with an electron sink in
    an organic mechanism.

        Electron sink
    An atom that accepts a new bond or lone pair of electrons. An electron sink is what an arrow points toward in an organic chemistry mechanism.

        An electron source is a bond or a lone pair of electrons. It is most commonly a p bond or a lone pair on an atom of relatively high electron density or a s bond that must break during a reaction. An electron sink is an atom on a molecule or an ion that can accept a new bond or lone pair of electrons.

        Learning to identify the characteristic sources and sinks in different functional groups is the key to learning organic chemistry reaction mechanisms. For example, for arrows that depict the formation of a new s bond between two molecules, the electron source is often readily identified as being a lone pair on the most electron- rich atom of one molecule or ion and the electron sink is readily identified as the most electron-poor atom of the other molecule or ion. Thus, the prediction of many of the most important electron sources and sinks comes down to lessons concerning the differences in electronegativity between atoms that were presented in Section 1.2, which allow you to identify the most electron-rich and electron-poor atoms in mol- ecules. As an aid to your analysis, the red and blue colors of the various electrostatic surface maps given throughout this book indicate the negative (electron-rich) and positive (electron-poor) regions of molecules. We will have more to say about this reactivity pattern a little later.
    This leads us to another commonly encountered type of process that deserves men- tion. As you will see in many later chapters, making a new bond to an electron sink often requires the simultaneous breaking of one of the bonds present at the sink atom to avoid overfilling its valence orbitals, a situation referred to as hypervalence


        B. Electronegativity and Chemical Bonds
    How do we estimate the degree of ionic or covalent character in a chemical bond? One way is to compare the electronegativities of the atoms involved. Electronegativity is a measure of an atom’s attraction for electrons that it shares in a chemical bond with another atom. The most widely used scale of electronegativities (Table 1.5) was devised by Linus Pauling in the 1930s.
    On the Pauling scale, fluorine, the most electronegative element, is assigned an electronegativity of 4.0 and all other elements are assigned values in relation to fluorine. As you study the electronegativity values in this table, note that they generally increase from left to right within a period of the Periodic Table and generally decrease from top to bottom within a group.Values increase from left to right because the increasing positive charge on the nucleus results in a greater force of attraction for the atom’s valence electrons. Electronegativity decreases from top to bottom be- cause the increasing distance of the valence electrons from the nucleus results in a lower attraction between the nucleus and these electrons.

        STEPS
        Forming new bonds:
        Find lone pair on the most electron rich atom. This is the electron source.
        Find most electron poor atom on other molecule or ion. Ths is the election sink.
        Add double-headed arrow from electron source to election sink.
        Breaking bonds (Bond breaking will occur to avoid overfilling valence (hypervalence) on an atom serving as an electron sink.)
        Source is the bond being broken.
        Sink is an atom able to accommodate the electrons as a lone pair, generally an elec- tronegative atom such as an O atom or a halogen.

        A proton is a subatomic particle found in the nucleus of every atom.

        You should now appreciate that the transfer of a proton (a so-called Brønsted acid-base reaction) is really just a special case of the common pattern of reactivity between an electron source (the base) and the proton as an electron sink, combined with the breaking of a bond to satisfy valence and create a relatively stable ion.
    The addition or removal of protons during chemical reactions is common and is often referred to as “adding a proton”or “taking a proton away."

    Meanwhile,a broader terminology is also applied to reactions in which news bonds form between electron-rich and electron-poor regions of molecules. Nucleophiles (meaning nucleus seeking) are molecules that have lone pairs or relatively electron-rich p bonds that act as electron sources for arrows making new bonds. Electrophiles (mean- ing electron seeking) are molecules with relatively electron-poor atoms that serve as sinks. Analogously, a molecule (or region of a molecule) that is a source for such an arrow is called nucleophilic, while a molecule or region of a molecule that is a sink for these ar- rows is referred to as being electrophilic. The term nucleophile is analogous to Lewis bases, and the term electrophile is analogous to Lewis acids. The choice of terminology depends on context. Nucleophile and electrophile are used more commonly in kinetics discussions, while Lewis acid and Lewis base are used in discussions of reaction thermodynamics.
    It is helpful to summarize the appropriate use of key terms associated with arrow pushing and reaction mechanisms. The terms source and sink are used to identify the start and end, respectively, of each reaction mechanism arrow, which is indicating the change in location of electron pairs. The terms nucleophile and electrophile (as well as Lewis base and Lewis acid) are used to describe molecules based on their chemi- cal reactivity and propensity to either donate or receive electrons when they interact. Protons can be thought of as a specific type of electrophile, and for reactions in which a proton is transferred, the nucleophile is called a base.

        D. Putting it All Together: A Multiple-Choice Situation
    In the sections and chapters that follow, many different reaction mechanisms will be de- scribed in a stepwise fashion. Each arrow can be classified according to one of the three overall situations we already encountered: (1) redistribution of p bonds and/or lone pairs, (2) formation of a new s bond from a lone pair or p bond, and (3) breaking of a s bond to give a new lone pair or p bond. When learning new mechanisms, focus on the overall transformation that takes place. It might be a reaction in which atoms or groups are added (an addition reaction), a reaction in which atoms or groups are removed (an elimination reaction), a reaction in which atoms or groups replace an atom or a group (a substitution reaction), or other processes we will encounter. Often, the overall process is composed of multiple steps. Once you have the overall process in mind, think about the individual steps that convert starting material(s) into product(s). Predicting complete multistep mechanisms, then, comes down to learning how to predict the individual steps.
    Understanding, as opposed to memorizing, mechanisms is critical to mastering organic chemistry. Although the mechanisms you encounter throughout the course may seem different, they are actually related in fundamental ways. In fact, almost all of the organic reaction mechanisms you will learn are composed of only a few different individual elements (steps) that are put together in various combinations. Your job is to learn these individual mechanism elements and then understand how to assemble them into the steps of the correct mechanism for an overall reaction.
    Fortunately, there are a surprisingly small number of different types of charac- teristic mechanism elements (patterns of arrows) to be considered when trying to predict individual steps of even complex chemical reactions. For this reason, you should view the prediction of each step in an organic mechanism as essentially a multiple-choice situation in which your most common choices are the following four:
    1   1 Make a new bond between a nucleophile (source for an arrow) and an elec- trophile (sink for an arrow). Use this element when there is a nucleophile pres- ent in the solution as well as an electrophile suitable for reaction to occur.

        2. Break a bond so that relatively stable molecules or ions are created. Use this element when there is no suitable nucleophile-electrophile or proton transfer reaction but breaking a bond can create neutral molecules or relatively stable ions or both.

        3. Add a proton. Use this element when there is no suitable nucleophile-electrophile reaction but a strong acid is present or the molecule has a strongly basic functional group.

        4. Take a proton away. Use this element when there is no suitable nucleophile- electrophile reaction but the molecule has a strongly acidic proton or a strong base is present.

        The situation is even simpler than you might expect because 1 and 2 are the func- tional reverse of each other, as are 3 and 4. Many times, more than one of the four choices occurs simultaneously in the same mechanistic step.
    These four mechanistic elements are the foundation upon which you will build an understanding of organic reaction mechanisms. They are far and away the most common; however, they are not the only mechanistic elements you will see. Once in a while, you will encounter a reaction with a unique mechanistic element specific to the particular molecules involved. For example, Section 6.4 describes a mechanistic ele- ment unique to hydroboration reactions. In addition, we will describe other important mechanistic elements, such as 1,2 shifts (Section 6.3C), that occur in several reactions.
    When you are able to predict which of the common mechanistic elements is/are most appropriate for a given step in a mechanism, you will be able to push electrons correctly without relying on memorization. Moreover, you will have taken a major step toward mastering organic chemistry. Throughout the rest of this book, we will label each mechanistic step as one of the common ones when appropriate, emphasiz- ing analogous features even between complex mechanisms.
